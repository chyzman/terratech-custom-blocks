---- [EPMS] Energy Pulse Modulator System ----

The EPMS is designed to operate on a charge that is penalized if the Tech is hit. 
Being hit once resets the EPMC charge on a Tech.

It is suggested that you install Sozin's ParticleManager mod for the best possible effects.


EPMC stands for Energy Pulse Modulator Cannon, a very powerful energy ordinance that can sear through multiple layers of armor. 
It's range is not all too impressive, making it useless for long-ranged attacks, but it homes in on enemies, making it less painful to aim.

The EPMCs require huge densities of battery charge to fire.

Most TAC techs are built for speed, maneuverability, and resilience, the EPMC system is designed to operate with maneuverability.

In return for it's safety, the EPMC system outputs TREMENDOUS damage in the form of controlled energy blasts. 

These blasts WILL disintegrate any projectile flung at it, denying counterattacks. 

The only way to counter an EPMC is with another EPMC.

PLANS:

// EPMC BASIC MAIN CANNONS
Version A-Class Release
-584332 + [EPMC] Cricket Main Cannon (1,1,2) //Charged particle blast, will reset charge if hit, weak built-in capacitor and 

The rest of the fighter-based EPMCs are going to be in EFF's arsenal, since they invented fighter/drone EPMCs

Version 0.7
584333 + [EPMC] Thyr Main Cannon 	(6,8,18)// Very powerful capital death beam Main Cannon to be built around,
  and can hard counter the faster modular EPMCs (excluding Sinewave) if used in time


//  EPMC Modular Cannons - Spools up and eats energy for a powerful finisher
// Will chain-detonate if critically damaged!  Will engulf the ship in flames upon Igniter detonation!
//(Powered by a projectile with a Tank collider cruising through a bunch of otherwise obstructed cannons)
Version 0.6
//   Sinewave charges a powerful barrage of shotgun ION particles that disable shields and eat heavy armor  (Valhalla's EO-2 Surge  - Alternative: Flame Strike)
584334 + [EPMC] Sinewave Burst Ignition 	(3,3,2)// Powerful modular energy cannon that builds up strength with each degree added
584335 + [EPMC] Sinewave Burst Side Amp 	(1,1,2)// Each 45 degrees adds 150 more damage
584340 + [EPMC] Sinewave Burst Corner Amp 	(1,1,2)// Each 45 degrees adds 150 more damage
584341 + [EPMC] Sinewave Burst Armor 		(3,3,2)// Defends the front of the Cannon

Version 0.7
//   Cosinewave stacks a singular, powerful energy ball that builds up with each ring passing capable of erasing fleets of tiny Techs  (Ragnarok's Atomic Supernova)
584342 + [EPMC] Cosinewave Collider Ignition 	(4,4,6)// Powerful modular energy cannon that builds up strength with each ring
584343 + [EPMC] Cosinewave Collider Amplifier 	(4,4,1)// Each ring adds an additional post-explosive to the final detonation
584344 + [EPMC] Cosinewave Collider Armor 	(4,4,2)// Defends the front of the Cannon

//   Tangent charges a multi-pronged attack that diverges on enemy collision to great effect vs frontsiders  (Hydra's Myriad Mauler - Alternative: Diversion Wave Cannon)
584345 + [EPMC] Tangent Splitter Ignition 	(2,2,5)// Powerful modular energy cannon that builds up strength with each degree added
584346 + [EPMC] Tangent Splitter Corner Amp 	(1,1,2)// Each 90 degrees adds an additional two convergence rays
584347 + [EPMC] Tangent Splitter Armor 	(2,2,2)// Defends the front of the Cannon

//-SAFETIES
584348 + Shunt Decoupler 	(3,2,1)// Force it away quickly before it explodes!  Point red side in direction of launch!
584349 + Decoupler Disarm	(1,1,1)// Place by the front of EPMC modular cannons. Disarms all decouplers from accidental ignition (requires BuffBlocks) - low health pool

//------------
// LEGACY
The below is obsolete due to the way the Terratech Energy system works
Now all EPMCs are fully-self contained, apart from requiring energy to fire.

//Heavy EPMC Cannon - getting hit once will reset ALL charge
-584332 + [EPMC] Particle Main Cannon (1,1,2) //Charged particle blast, will reset charge if hit, weak built-in capacitor and Accumulator
-584333 + [EPMC] Dense Main Cannon (1,1,4) //Charged particle beam, will reset charge if hit
-584334 + [EPMC] Shockwave Main Cannon (3,1,3) //Charged particle shock, will reset charge if hit
-584335 + [EPMC] Mjolnir Heavy Main Cannon (4,5,6) //*Mother Of All Positron Cannons*


//Capacitors
//Holds Wave Cannon charge, and ultimately determines how long it fires
//They have decent health, lower than average and explode with ENERGY rather than just explosion
-584340 + Small EMPC Capacitor (1,1,1) //holds Sub-Par amount of particles
-584341 + Medium EMPC Capacitor (1,1,3) //holds meh amount of particles
-584342 + Large EMPC Capacitor (2,2,2) //lotta particles, LOTTA BOOM

//Accumulators
//How to charge the blasted guns
//They are not as explosive but do not feature much health
-584343 + EMPC Light Particle Accumulator (1,2,2) //weak, slow collect time
-584344 + EMPC Fighter Particle Accumulator (2,2,2) //moderate, slow collect time
-584345 + EMPC Capital Particle Accumulator (4,2,5) //strong, fast collect time
