Mind the asymetricallity. \nAll the other corps and their \"cost-effective\" one blocks can't beat this for quality! \nplease um, mind the price though :/ \n\n\nAhh, If it isn't the famous one block, the lore supreme, the first impression. \n\nWhat should I put here? Oh yes, that one time the AD AI <b>Yue</b> rode a tank up the central TAC staircase, oh boy.  First time ever anyone had a tank on the roof of the HQ.  You should have seen the look on <b>Anjaro's</b> face when he saw the mess lol! \n\nHow is that relevant?  A part of that staircase railing that looks sort of like a doorknob fell off and knocked <b>Anjaro</b> on the head, which gave him the idea of designing this block. \n\nWhatâ€™s this? A <b>mushroom?</b>", //You can make multiple lines with \n
