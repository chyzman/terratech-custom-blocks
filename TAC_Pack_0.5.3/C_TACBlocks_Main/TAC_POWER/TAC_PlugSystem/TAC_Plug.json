	"Name": "TAC Phase Plug",
	"Description": "A mighty Phase Foam plug that lets you receive effective charge from your local outlet at almost melee distance. \n\nThere is widespread crticism for using outdated technology to charge things.  Why even bother with plugs anymore with all this wireless charging?  You just have to exist in the room to charge your phone and it'd be fine. \nBut here's the problem, your Tech isn't exactly a phone and your base isn't being productive with that one silo missing the required resources.  It is this very reason we bring back the mighty plug, despite its cumbersome nature of having to get close to the power supply. \n\n\nUsing unstable Ionic Wrap Foil dipped in a vat of cyrogenically liquidated Proxima Dark and Olastic Bricks and then set to dry by excited, Pulverised Luxite, it results in a stable, yet unstable compound called Phase Foam that retains its shape but also can phase through other objects while still being perfectly capable of transferring mass electric charges given direct contact with a properly structured conductive output.", //You can make multiple lines with \n
