Leg may love game bugs, but bugs in this pack are not really the fun bugs!

----------------------------------------------------------

TAC Corp Summary:
TAC is all for high-quality Techs. This means high speeds, outstanding armor, and effective weapons at small scales and unreasonable costs. There will be no intimidation from TAC Techs but there sure will be underestimation.

Retro-Future is the style it was aesthetically aiming for. A mix of not too retro-sci-fi backed up by modern designs, and a bonus splash of experimental aspects.

If you would try to compare it to vanilla corps, it would be Hawkeye, GSO, Better Future, and Reticle Research in a mixed up jumble. 

It's far from the Lemon Kingdom mentality of being big, bulky, powerful, and slow
It's also not manipulation of elements and environment like GreenTech
TAC wants to go fast, furious, strong, and small. Like modern vehicles...

TAC Blocks have slightly more health than HE blocks. 
Same weight class as GSO in some cases.
You could build small and not worry too much about being destroyed.

The main problem being that the costs of said blocks of other corps has overall greater efficiency than what TAC blocks provide of overinflated build costs.

Basically TAC Blocks are generally overpriced in a very unhealthy way. 

There are 125+ Blocks in this Pack!

~~~Summaries~~~
AI Modules & Manipulators(0.7):
This is what's neat: You can build a Tech using one of these as the first part, then build off of it and save it later without normal player cabs. When you want to chill or let the AI do the killing for you, you just swap to said tech, and watch the automated carnage!

Manipulators control what a Tech does when an enemy is nearby. Will we try to stay at the same height level as said enemy? How about homing in on an enemy automatically? Do we want to stay away from the enemy? 

Building Blocks:
Their uses are also greatly limited due to the unordinary designs, but can live through some nasty explosions and resist popping off.

Cabs:
You can't really get any more mobile than the HovaBugga Cab. Pair it up with the Cab Frame Block for maximum escape planning!
The Undertaker Mainframe Cab takes absolutely no damage from explosions, but it also has no guns or wheels. It is the PERFECT cab to hide, and ONLY hide!

Mobility:
Gotta Go Fast, is that right?
LUDICROUSLY expensive wheels that cruise around at 80 mph or above (or slower when overburdened)
Unresponsive *Jet Engines* that achieve higher levels of thrust than any prop can manage, incompatible with props and different jet engine models.
Spaceship engines and thrusters to get going through the skies, FAST.

Weapons: 
Mostly a slur of abnormal-particle weapons, some of them bypass shields, some of then explode violently, and some have significant range.
Missiles are fast, VLRS, or nuclear in quality.
+ Experimental Cannon that launches wrecking balls
+ interceptor gun

Utility:
Check this out for yourself, plenty of goodies.

Base:
Mobile fabrication things, a long-distance block magnet, and a rotating anchor.

Control: Cabs, Radars, Cab Mounts, etc
Wheels: Wheels and Standard blocks
Weapons: Weapon Blocks
Power: Power Blocks
Base: Base Blocks

TAC_Pack Beta Version 0.5.3 - Bath Before the Hurricane

ANNOUNCEMENT:
With the advent of NuterraSteam, the TAC Pack will continue to be developed on Forums as the Unofficial Block Injector still and always 
serves as a powerful development platform.
The workflow will remain the same until the final shift to Steam:
Testbench >>> Unofficial >>> Steam

Model overhauls for:
Positivity Supercharger, Long Tom Positron, AIM-ALL, Pancake Battery, Waffle Battery
All Shields now have a broadcasting effect

!! -WARNING- !!
A BLOCK HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE SIZE OF THE LONG TOM POSITRON! (lower clipping area with the large copper bump)
CHECK FOR MISSING BLOCKS!

Significant Changes:
>>>The existing bulkhead doors will be moving to special soon<<<
- a duplicate that's cheaper and not indestructable will be in it's place.
Cleanup of some errors and reduced unused textures in the Block Injector - loading time should be reduced

+++ Added support for RandomAdditions 
- When RandomAdditions is installed: 
Most TAC armored blocks lose their armor typing and become standard, but:
Bendpoints and some others become invulnerable to damage caused by explosions (not the typing, the AoE) only
all Normal TAC blocks greatly reduce incoming damage caused by explosions (not the typing, the AoE) as originally intended
This throws TAC into that special position where TAC is used against powerful enemies while also becoming prone to weakness 
against normal enemies.

? Some Jumbo Jet wings (TAC's wings) now have updated desc showing that they need at least 80 MPH top speed to upkeep their lift.

+/- All "lasers" have been renamed to Shock Cannons or Dense Energy Cannons to better represent their projectile type.
+/- Other weapons have been renamed appropreately.

+++ The Repair Bee Commando has been retrived from the water and is now water-proofed
The Repair Bee Commando is back in the block menu!

++ HUGE BUFFS to walker leg health pools as they weren't edited at all from testing to release
They are still slower than normal wheels and do not feature wall sticking (look to the smaller walker legs in the future)
Changed Stalker Spikes Health from untested default value 7500 to 52,500
Changed Stringer Legs Health from untested default value 7500 to 42,500

++ Fixes to shotgun damage handling - a powerful vanilla shotgun alpha-strike will no longer eradicate a TAC tech in one go
Previously almost all TAC blocks blocked nothing and allowed damage to be applied straight through
Now:
All armor slabs entirely block shotgun blasts
Additionally, normal TAC blocks also block shotgun blasts by 0.9 (vs the typical 0.8), making them effective again, the rings get a damage resistance bonus.
Surface-mounted turrets that extend beneath the hull also entirely block shotgun blasts from getting inside
Bendpoints and internal components remain incapable of blocking any shotgun penentration whatsoever

+ Buffed Speedomatic Tank Tracks
They now are less likly to stall
Overload slowdown force changed from 85000 to 45000

+ Overhaul to Mark 8 Wheels
They now come with a built-in hover controller
Adjusted hover vectors to allow proper control at max strength - now they should operate like intended
Hover-based wall sticking has been buffed and tuned to climb 90 degree inclines like intended
Hover effects mounted to wheel properly

+ Overhaul to Argentavis Interceptor Rifle - should now actually stop projectiles
Remaned to Argentavis EPMS Interceptor Rifle
It remains a power-free defense measure as it still messes with allied shots.
It now fires for appox. 1.75 seconds and then reloads for 8, and the inaccuracy was increased to cover more trailing projectiles.
Unlike other types of defense, this active defense can be used to stop shield-bypassing projectiles, but far less likely compared to interception of normal projectiles.

+ Buff to Retroburner Shotgun, should now be far more forceful and gain some viability late-game.
Changed damage per-hit from 4 to 10
Changed launch force duration from 3.0 to 2.6 seconds
Changed launch force strength per-hit from 250 to 400
Changed launch force spread from 2.0 to 5.0
Changed maximum range from 20 to 24

+ Buff to Ethereal Lancer Shotgun to make it more suitable for lategame, huge given phasing (stacks fast - can kill cabs with little to no resistance)
Aiming range is still heavily restricted
Changed damage per-hit from 125 to 150
Changed maximum range from 30 to 42

+ Overhaul to all Capital Class Laser Turrets
Renamed to Shock Cannons appropreately
Using the Meteor Turret as a basis:
Halved Armor Penentration effect
Changed Cooldown from 4.2 to 1.95
Lowered Damage per hit
Added burst stagger fire effect to increase combat efficiency (and make it more asthetic to the source material)
Overall, DPS should have improved and be on par with Meteor Turret (but deal more against layered armor)

+/- Overhaul to Long Tom Positron
Renamed to Shock Cannon appropreately
Fixed Crash issue on Fantastic Graphics
Using the Capital Class Laser Turret overhaul as a basis:
Changed contact damage per-hit from 4500 to 2000
Changed Cooldown from 1.5 to 1.95
Changed Projectile Velocity from 150 to 200
Changed vertical Aim range from 45 to 75
Fix to Long Tom Positron's powerful piercing effect
Reduced contact Armor Penentration effect from 1.0 to 0.75
Aiming Pivot has changed to make power supplies look more feasable
Added three more APs to the back bottom

+/- Overhaul to Positivity Supercharger
Renamed to P.S. Tractor Beam since it works like intended now
Consistancy has been changed to be consistant per-frame (may have a slight performance impact)
As a result:
Should no longer break when a fire-rate increasing buffblock is placed upon it
Targets should be pulled along FAR more realistically
It deals less damage from ground collisions but should also be less lethal when used for allied purposes (yes it works on allies)

+/- Overhaul to Torque Gyro
Renamed to Torque Single-Axis Gyro
Added resistive forces to the Torque Gyro to give it a more realistic torque effect and reduce wobble.
It's remains weaker than the BF passive all-axis.
Increased stability on the Torque Gyro.  This makes it react slower but stronger, far more suitable now for larger designs.


Changes:
++ Tremendous buffs all-round for Extruder Gun
+ Buffed Spark and Extruder maximum firerate
+ Visual improvements to all TAC boosters
+ Fix to Toothpaste Laser Crash issue on Fantastic Graphics
+ Fix to Theta and Donut Block colliders
+ Fix to Center Of Mass of new Angular wings
+ Fix to Possession Steriopticon grabbing effects
+ Fix to missing AP on Zephyrus Antigrav
+ Fixed some more typos
+ Velocity buff to Extruder Gun: Was 80, now 115
+ Velocity buff to Dreadnaught Laser to match others: Was 175, now 200
+ Changed Extruder Gun from explosive to armor typing to increase viability as a small tech weapon
+ Changed Cross-Beam Turret from shield to armor typing to increase viability
+ Reduced explosions from all intakes as the overhead makes them painful enough
+ Fixed colliders on Pivelite Auto Cannon

+ Fixed some model shapes and coloring flaws

+/- Halved projectile count of Pivelite but kept the DPS the same
+/- Changed Light Praetorian Turret to fire faster but deal the same DPS
+/- Fixed messed up stats of the TAC Manager (confused the file with a future upcoming corp's "overdrive")
+/- All current TAC AIs are now AI Cores - Reliant on TACtical AI TTMM Mod to function 

- Changed Reilegh Turret from armor to shield typing to make it high-risk, high-reward
- Greatly lowered Halberd Toothpaste Laser DPS
- Made Trundles slippery like they were supposed to be


// New blocks
584296 + Mark 8 Wheel (fenderless) 	(2,1,1) //Basic hover car wheel

584352 + Vernier Adjustment Thruster 	(2,1,2) //Strong, sideways one-directional fuel thruster


-----------------------------------------------------------
TAC_Pack Beta Version 0.5.1 - The Unpopping
Announcements:
Bugfixes after Major Shield Update!

Model overhauls for:
Turbulence, Pivelite, Trundle, Light Praetorian, Reliegh Cannons, Cross-Beam Cannons, Ancestor
WARNING: ONE AP WAS REMOVED FROM THE TRUNDLE WHEEL - Check for loose parts!

Naval Ship parts are incoming, with very high buoyancy for the cost of unused volume spaces.

Significant Changes:
Disabled deflective properties of all Reactive Armor since it was causing issues for the recent weapons
Removed idle thruster effects from HVU thrusters to reduce lag
Removed unnesseary hover effects from the  Garnigho Starship Engine to reduce lag
TAC EPMC Defense Matrix nerfed from radius 35.0 to 22.5 and damage drain increased to prevent just flat out making other TAC shields obsolete.
Yes I am aware that the LK Solaris and other BL weapons clip through it, no it was >>>not<<< meant to be an apex shield.  
The way it's built was for smaller tech surviability reasons.

More wing patches, shouldn't bug out as often anymore

Overhaul to TAC AIs - they now can slightly fire while out of player range and use attached boosters (need buffblocks installed)
Allied AI turret now does it's job whilist stationary

+ Fixed all shield/repair generators
+ Fix to Polaris Wing collider blocking off it's cutout
+ Fix to Jagged Shift armor denying small block retreval from within

Thanks to the help of Helios, I have acquired a nice point to balance around, so I can now make other weapons feel relevant rather than exist underpowered
+ Buffed Ancestor Heavy-Repeating Carbine projectile speed (95 -> 135), damage (40 -> 65) and accuraccy (0.25 -> 0.12) and nerfed kickback (30.0 -> 50.0) 
+ Buffed Meteor Laser Turret damage (75 -> 150) and accuraccy (0.15 -> 0.075)
+ Buffed Kiyashima Turret damage (1000 -> 1225)
+ Tweaked Ethreal Lance to deal 125 energy damage every 3 seconds, now much more threatening
+ KRAM ICBM was given some movement under the water
+ Fixed Draccor Missile shield bypass issue

- Nerfed Zorg missile launch flight speed, it now aims correctly, will still miss point-blank.
- LARGE nerf to Dreadnaught Laser cannon, now identical stats to the Battleship Laser but with 30 more damage per shot
This was due to the devastating effects of the doubled firerate and the AP effect stacking far more damage than expected


+/- Changed SFX of Dreadnaught and Battlecruiser turrets to work nicer
-/+ Energy Pulse Modulator System Beam Gun renamed and overhauled to Halberd Toothpaste Laser
Now has a shorter range, and a smaller explosion, but handles like an actual toothpaste laser now


// New blocks

584470 + Tempest Jet Engine 		(1,1,3) //Smol jet engine like the turb but Zero Prop-sized for ease of use

More wing parts
584385 + Left Short Flexi Wing 		(2,2,3) //Left Shorter Flexi
584386 + Right Short Flexi Wing 	(2,2,3) //Right Shorter Flexi
584387 + Tiny Neutralis Wing 		(1,2,2) //tiny Neutralis




-----------------------------------------------------------
TAC_Pack Beta Version 0.5.0 - Base and Space Update
Announcement:
WARNING! 
Once TAC Fuel tanks come out, the Compressors will lose most of their fuel reserves!

Significant Changes:
+/- Repair Bee Nest overhauled to repair own player Tech blocks when there are no enemies nearby, weaker attacks overall but can automatically pluck blocks from enemies and grab loose blocks from the battlefield.

+/- Tweaks to ION Cannon - Greatly reduced damage and buffed firerate to make it feel less niche

+/- Tweaks to various armor blocks after finding cost-related inconsistancies

+ All missiles except the nuke were updated to work within water - nuclear torpedoes are too spoopy
+ All Half Slabs and related were buffed from 450 HP density to 750 HP density with mini-changes accordingly to make them viable as high-resistance armor
Also made their colliders a bit bigger than they actually are to permit usage as flooring
+ Stalker Legs can now strafe
+ New models for TAC Projector bubbles
+ Ethereal Lancer Shotgun damage buffed from 20 to 50 and overhauled effects
+ Tweaked Speedomatic Tank Tracks to work better when used in pairs

--------------
CHANGELOG:
TAC_Pack Beta Version 0.3.3_F
Announcements:
This version of TAC Pack is to be released on the forums

Significant Changes:
+ Lots of cleaning up in here

--------------
TAC_Pack Beta Version 0.3.3

New Additions:
584276 + Hashpoint Block (1,2,2) //TAC's Bracket-Chassis Part
584277 + Gridpoint Block (2,2,2) //TAC's Bracket-Grid Part

Significant Changes:
+ Almost all blocks have pictures thanks to HeX's block snapshot skills

+ All TAC Blocks now have greatly increased blast resistance, meaning that it's far harder to take out a TAC Tech with only explosives than any other corp. This was done in part to make even the smallest of TAC Techs deadly.
Currently this isn't working though because the functionality seems to be missing from the game as of recently...

+ So for now, the Bendpoint TAC blocks will be using Shield as their armor type.
The Other TAC blocks will be using Armor.

+ Buff to Praetorian - Now hits more than once(it should have been doing that a long time ago, silly me) and deals more "heat" damage. Deals incredible damage if it hits a weak spot in the enemy. Will deal minimal damage if it hits slanted armor though.

Changes:
+ Fixed Droney from flying away
+ Reduced recoil from Light Praetorian Turret from 4750 to 750
+ Buffed Draccor missile launcher to not be too badly overshadowed by the far cheaper HE Seeker Missiles
+ Reilegh and Toothpaste Laser now deal Plasma damage
+ Spark now deals Energy damage
+ Increased weight(x10) and fling (500->750) on Spheroth projectile to fling techs around
+ Buffed and Balanced the damage application on the Cross-Beam and Reilegh
+ Buff to Toothpaste Laser so that it now deals decent damage
+ Hoarg Repair projector now heals 2000 a second rather than 200
+ Shield generators no longer eat entire batteries under basic attacks
+ Waffle Battery now has built-in generation and explosion resistance because it felt very hard to use before
+ Fixed some errors in the Blocks List here

+ Buffed the KRAM's explosion from 20 to 22.5 and max damage radius from 12.5 to 20

Cancelled in favor of giving the KRAM the ability to be PLASMA:
+ Buffed the KRAM's explosion from 20 to 25 and the max damage radius from 12.5 to 22.5
+ Buffed the KRAM's explosive damage from 2250 to 2500

Known Issues:
- Foolish mistakes mixing up area with volume in JSON descriptions exist
- Base model on the Speedomatic Tank Treads needs updating to fit nicely. Current model is for 2x3x8 stretched to 2x3x10
- Below is not working:
?+ All Bendpoint Bracket Blocks now take zero damage from explosions, fixed masses.
?+ Made Bulkhead Door Parts unaffected by indirect explosions: 0.175 -> 0.0


Notes:
- Bulkhead Door may receive an overhaul in the future to only be a two-part block.
- The Gimbal Jet is not working as intended, the block injector code for custom aerofoils is bugged rn.
