  "Name": "Hyperion Systems Righter Gyro",
  "Description": "A gyroscope with enough power to rival even the GSO gyro in corrective power for size. Actually, it makes the GSO gyro look puny! Double the correction power, in a one-celled, convenient package. But it also has less AP's. Also alot less health... but we don't talk about that little detail.",
