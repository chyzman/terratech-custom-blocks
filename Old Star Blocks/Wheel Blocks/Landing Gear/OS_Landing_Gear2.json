  "Name": "Old Star Straight Landing Gear Alt",
  "Description": "Now this is how Old Star do. With Old Star Taking to the skies they needed lighter weight wheels that do not take too much space and keep aircraft from landing on thier hulls. With similar capabilites to the Caster Wheels, the Old Star's landing gear will ensure you can land your aircraft safely.",
