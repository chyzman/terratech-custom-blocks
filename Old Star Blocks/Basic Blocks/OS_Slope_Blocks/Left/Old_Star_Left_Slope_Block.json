  "Name": "Old Star Right Slope Block",
  "Description": "This here is how the Old Star do. Just 2 cuts of nicely cut Fibron Hardwood held together with a few metal bands and nails. It's a slope block to smooth out right side corners of our techs that use the main slope block... if we wanted that is but on a list of things to do, a slope blocks just seem to be a necessity for some people despite that bringing an Old Star tech into a firefight really isn't the brightest option. . . .",
