  "Name": "Old Star Curved Slope Block",
  "Description": "This here is how the Old Star do. Just 2 cuts of nicely cut Fibron Hardwood held together with a few metal bands and nails.   Now I know what you're thinking. Sure I said Hard wood, but its still wood. DO NOT think that this is some armor block but since its made of harder wood it can take a beating a wee bit more than our usual blocks but it's also heavier.",
