  "Name": "Old Star Heavy Iron Single Block",
  "Description": "When it comes to mining and armor Old Star's subdivision 'Heavy Iron' takes over! Heavy Iron's basic building blocks have 3 times the health compared to the rest of Old Star to deal with the amount of stress the blocks take in the mines. Due to this they also have 3 times the weight. Tho this isn't much when comparing Old Star in general to everyone elses blocks.",
