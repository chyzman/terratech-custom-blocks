  "Description": "From a time long ago, TerraTech building styles were used, but under the name, \"Besiege\". A time where things were customizable, weapons were manually controlled on gimbal mounts, and techs were war machines. This artifact is still in use as a cab, although even Reticule Research cannot comprehend how you got into it... However, the ancients knew what they were doing, as it is almost unbreakable. \n\nCommemoration of the game Besiege having its 1.0 release.",
