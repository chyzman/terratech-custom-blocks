  "Description": "From a time long ago, TerraTech building styles were used, but under the name, \"Besiege\". A time where things were customizable, weapons were manually controlled, and techs were known only as war machines. This artifact is still in use as a two block, although old and wooden, it is still tough... \n\nCommemoration of the game Besiege having its full release.",
