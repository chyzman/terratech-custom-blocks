  "Description": "Nicknamed an Altispeedometer by Reticule Research, it is a purpose built altimeter to measure your height from sea level. It is supposed to emit a signal to do something, although that seems to have been lost to time. It also has been outfitted with a speedometer to tell you how fast you are going.",
