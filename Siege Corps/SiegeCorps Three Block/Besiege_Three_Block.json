  "Name": "SiegeCorps Three Block",
  "Description": "From a time long ago, TerraTech building styles were used, but under the name, \"Besiege\". A time where things were customizable, weapons were manually controlled, and techs were known only as war machines. This artifact is still in use as a three block, although old and wooden, it is still tough... \n\nCommemoration of the game Besiege having its full release. If you like TerraTech and want games similar to it, I would recommend it. It is only $8 on the Steam Store, and features are quite similar to TerraTech in terms of building.",
