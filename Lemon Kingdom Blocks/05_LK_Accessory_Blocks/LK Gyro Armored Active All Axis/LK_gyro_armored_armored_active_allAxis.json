These \"Gyros\" are different compared to others: within is a miniature black hole, stabilized by all those gravitic pads spinning around it. Very powerful...but do not worry, if the gyro is destroyed, so too does black hole as it will simply evaporate due to its size.\"\n\n - Gregory Rook, Guildsman, Note #72",
