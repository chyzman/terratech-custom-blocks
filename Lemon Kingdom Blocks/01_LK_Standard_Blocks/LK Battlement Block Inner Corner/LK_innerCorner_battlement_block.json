This one has more room to take cover in.\n\n\"Knight companies however, despite strategic and materiel superiority, must be prepared to operate with the mindset that the enemy has the regional advantage. When the enemy realizes some form of imbalance, whether in terms of firepower, technological or strategic disparity, it will adjust to exploit LK weaknesses.\"\n\n-- Infantry Field Manual",
