    "Name":                 "LK Small Sloped Armor",
    "Description":          "A standard-issue armor block from the Lemon Kingdom. This block will not break off when hit and is extremely durable. \n\n \"My charge is to oversee the creation of materiel that our Militum uses. Meta-materials for armor, weapons and equipment among others, it is all made here. While most of our equipment is fully autonomous, we do have employees, all of which have taken an oath of secrecy and a hefty paycheck. You can understand that such secrets are vital to our operations.\" -- Caesar Auroch, Chief Forgemaster, Excerpt 1",
