    "Name":                 "LK Corner Sloped Armor",
    "Description":          "An diagonally wrought armor block from the Zesty Realm. This block will not break off when hit and is extremely durable. \n\n \"Our techniques in the forges are a mixture of old and new. Of course we use Computer Aided Design, but we use 21st century metalworking methods as our foundation, then we use nanobots in a partial vacuum to eliminate miniature defects.\" -- Caesar Auroch, Chief Forgemaster, Excerpt 2",
