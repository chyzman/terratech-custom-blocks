It doesn't have a detonator because we spent all 100,000 BB of the cost on explosives, but you can put a Z4 in the inner space to replace the detonator! Do not have a Z4? Even a hammer will work, it only has 150 HP, so even a child can explode it! \n\nPrecautions for use: Do not hit with a hammer" , //You can make multiple lines with \n
