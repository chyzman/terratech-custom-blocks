  "Description": "An all-in-one structural block for the non-radar informational needs of DarkLight techs. Best used alongside cabs in the core of ally vehicles.\n\n\nInstead of the usual energy symbol, we instead have chosen to put the Alkis Gals solar system's symbol on. For all they have done and contributed to DarkLight, they do deserve recognition.",
