  "Name": "DarkLight Scouter Radar",
  "Description": "Also known as 'That one radar that has too much radar', the Scouter Radar is a small yet powerful device. Sporting <b>five</b> radars on a base that rotates all five radars for them, it's easily able to detect anything in its range with that many radars. Still needs outside support for weapon range increasers.",
