  // For great control of a block without creating a C# mod, such a system exists that you can modify the Hierarchy, and variables, of one.

  //If you have any problems, recommendations, or seek for guidance, ask on the Forum or official TerraTech Discord (discord.gg/terratechgame)
  //It may be necessary to examine the hierarchy of the block you wish to base your block on. You can do that by pressing backslash with your mouse on top of that block, with the Control Blocks mod installed, or by dumping the block's JSON with Misc Mods.
