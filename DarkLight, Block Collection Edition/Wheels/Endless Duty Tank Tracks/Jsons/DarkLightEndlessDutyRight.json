This is the left version, which is just an inversed right one which someone attempted to pass off as the right version.\n\nThe wheels only phase through reality itself while not being on the tech is due to them making tech functionality far more difficult if they can collide with the planet while not on a tech. <b>It's just how science works.</b>",
