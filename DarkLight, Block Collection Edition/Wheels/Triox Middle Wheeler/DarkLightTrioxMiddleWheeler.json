The middle version of the <color=purple>Triox</color> is an even wider wheel block than before, sporting multiple armor platings and the capability to be properly put under techs to not be taking up 30 blocks of space outside. It can take quite a beating. We don't know why it naturally leans to the right, hope the rotation system works in your favor.\n\n\nStill made of rubber, hydraulic presses, and <b>armor.</b>",
