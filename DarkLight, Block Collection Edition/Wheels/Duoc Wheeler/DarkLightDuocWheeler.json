  "Name": "DarkLight Duoc Wheeler",
  "Description": "The most basic wheel you're going to get here, works very well but is rather fragile since it doesn't even have the same durability as the Brudger One Block.\n\nOne of the designers had noticed that one block wheels proved to have many issues, the solution? Shove two wheels together with a bunch of hydraulic presses and give it an actual suspension unlike those one block wheels.\n\n\nThis wheel goes nyoom, but is not fastest nyoom.",
