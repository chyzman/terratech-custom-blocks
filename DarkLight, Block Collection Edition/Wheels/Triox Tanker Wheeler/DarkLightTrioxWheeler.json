  "Name": "DarkLight Triox Tanker Wheeler",
  "Description": "Now THIS is no basic wheel. The <color=purple>Triox</color> is a rather wide and armored wheel, allowing for larger versions of 'Duoc Caterpillars' that are far stronger. It also sports a small 'Mammoth' Armor Plating over the ventilation. Only issue is the massive amount of space it takes up.. and it being rubber, keep it safe from your own weaponry.\n\n\nYou may think this was also made by shoving wheels together with hydraulic presses. It was not, It's made of rubber, hydraulic presses, and <b>armor.</b>",
