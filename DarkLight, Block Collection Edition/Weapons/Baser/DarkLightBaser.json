  "Name": "DarkLight Baser Micro Cannon",
  "Description": "The companion weapon to the Arcis, the Baser is an actually decent \"small\" cannon weapon with more existent gimbaling. It doesn't have nearly as many APs but can be put without breaking any sort of 'flow' on the chosen DarkLight Tech. It also likes to dishinge the vertical rotation part for some reason.\n\n\nWhen most people hear this weapon's name, they'd expect a laser. They get a cannon instead.",
