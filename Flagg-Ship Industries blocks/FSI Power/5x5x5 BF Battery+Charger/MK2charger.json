	"Name": "Power Complex MK2 shield",
	"Description": "With the discovery of an unknown element, simply named 'Chaos,' The Mark 2 Singularity power complex empowers the singularity with the strange energy to futher saturate it. It is strangly stable as a result... It's still extremely heavy, though roughly the same as the MK1. \nThis also acts as a wireless charger due to the nature of the shield. It's not as strong as the inline charger, but it transfers much faster. (Note from the mod creator, i am unable to make it into both a charger and a battery, so i've split up the item in two parts. This is the charger.)", //You can make multiple lines with \n
